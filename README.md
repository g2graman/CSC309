SpaceInvaders
-------------
This project is a reconstruction of the classical "Space Invaders" in HTML and JavaScript, to be played entirely on the client-side. It is played by moving the tank left or right with the according left and right arrow keys, and by shooting the opposing aliens with the spacebar but beware to use your bullets efficiently, because you can only shoot one at a time! Your score can be seen in the upper left-hand corner and your remaining lives can be seen in the upper right-hand corner in the form of heart pictorials. When your lives run out or the aliens reach the bottom, it's game over, after which you will be prompted to play again. Enjoy!
