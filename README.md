## CSC309H

The repository that hosts the assignments from the Winter offering of CSC309H1 in 2014 for both Aashni Shah (g2aashni, who can be contacted through [her website](http://aashni.me/)) and Francesco Gramano (g2graman, who can be contacted through his website [his website](http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/~g2graman/))

In this repository you will find three folders:
- SpaceInvaders
- a2
- connect4

The purpose of each of this is described through the readme found at the root of each folder, safe connect4. In brief, SpaceInvaders is a reconstruction of the classic "Space Invaders" in HTML and JavaScript, a2 is a design for an online application for a candystore including checkout functionality, and last but not least connect4 is a reconstruction of the classic "Connect Four" which is meant to be played concurrently with two players.
