Things to note/questions:

 - What type of board type do we want?
 - What input do we require for the board?
 - Will our board have images? or just be a text board?
    - if we do images, I vote for a something abnormal, like doge vs. gaben
      or luke vs. darth vader or harry vs. voldermort, or a pineapple vs. an
      umbrella (coz why the hell not?)
    - actually.. if we're being adventurous, we could let them pick who they
      want to be (or randomly assign it to them) out of a list of possible
      choices, use session to track which one was "selected" since we can't
      make changes to the db schema, and make sure that the two players are
      not the same...
  - Can the players click on the spot they want their piece to go
    or will they need to type in a location co-ordinate?
 - Will we use location co-ordinates to figure out which piece to play?
 - How would we determine who the winner of the board is
 - Check for illegal moves
